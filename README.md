# ECSP1 - Project Documentation 

This repo serves as the basis for the OPF documentation site at: [replace_with_your_gitlab.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/core/](https://.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/core/). The site gets auto-deployed every time a commit is pushed.

It also serves as the repo that is used for project management where we track our [backlog](), [issue boards]() and sprints.

---

<small>The documentation site is based on **Open Project Framework (OPF)**. This version of OPF is used for all kind of project setups at JAMK</small>.
