# WHAT IS THIS REPOSITORY?
This repository is a personal copy of the basis for our documentation site for ECSP1 - Project: https://core-e28f4a.pages.labranet.jamk.fi/#project-ecsp1-ecommerce-server-platform-v10. The original repository also served as project management platform to track issue boards, project backlog, and sprints.

No code from the project is found here. My duties in the project were mostly concerned with managing issues related to the security of the project and the e-commerce platform. This was a team effort, but you can see my contributions in [project plan](/core-main/docs/10-Project-management/project-plan.md), 

# ECSP1 & OHTU 2025
During 17.03.2025 - 12.09.2025 I participated in a comprehensive Modern Software Production education program (OHTU 2025) organized by Jyväskylä University of Applied Science (JAMK) that provided in-depth exposure to software production concepts, techniques, and methodologies. This intensive program was designed for individuals seeking to master the complete software development lifecycle, including defining, designing, implementing, and testing software solutions. The course was delivered primarily through online contact teaching and guided distance learning, bringing together 12 carefully selected participants for an immersive learning experience that combined theoretical knowledge with practical application.

The program structure consisted of approximately 50 days of theoretical training followed by a 60-day work-based learning period, which I completed through project team collaboration with 6 people focused on modifying and deploying a functional e-commerce platform. Key themes throughout the curriculum included project management framewroks (Agile, Scrum etc.), service design, integrations, information security, testing, working with virtual and containerized environments, use of AI, and the fundamentals of service production automation, with software production serving as the primary focus area.

The program was specifically tailored to address the testing needs of Central Finland companies while strengthening participants' existing competencies through personalized competency development plans (HOKS). This comprehensive approach ensured that graduates emerged with both solid theoretical foundations and practical experience applicable to real-world software production environments, particularly emphasizing the security, containerization, and automation aspects that are crucial in contemporary software development practices.
