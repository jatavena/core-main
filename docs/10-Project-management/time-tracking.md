## About worktime reporting

We collect worktime report in software project for various reasons, such as:

- To track and measure the productivity and performance of the software development team. Worktime report can show how much time each team member spends on different tasks, such as coding, testing, debugging, reviewing, etc. This can help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the team, and to provide feedback and improvement suggestions. ¹²
- To monitor and optimize the software usage and costs. Worktime report can show how often and how long a particular software is used by the team or the clients. This can help to determine the value and efficiency of the software, and to decide whether to continue, upgrade, or terminate the software license. ³
- To plan and manage the software project scope, schedule, and budget. Worktime report can show the actual time and costs spent on the software project, and compare them with the planned or estimated time and costs. This can help to evaluate the progress and status of the project, and to identify and mitigate any risks or issues that may affect the project delivery. ⁴²
- To report and communicate the software project results and value to the stakeholders and clients. Worktime report can show the outcomes and benefits of the software project, such as the features, functionality, quality, and user satisfaction of the software product. This can help to demonstrate the value and impact of the software project, and to justify the investment and resources allocated to the project. ²⁴

These are some of the reasons why we collect worktime report in software project. Worktime report can help to improve the software development process, the software product, and the software project management.
