## Introduction

In this Communication Plan document we will define the channels and methods of communication used during the Prestashop project.

## Project Stakeholders:
Project Stakeholders can be divided into groups from the point of view of communication:

- **Project Group Team Members**: [Team members]( docs/10-Project-management/team-introduction.md )  
- **Project Manager(s) and Coaches**: Okko Tuuri, Narsu  
- **Stakeholder Representatives**: Narsu
<!-- **Other External Stakeholders**: Business Owners, Competitors, Customers, Government, Investors, Lenders, Partners. -->



## General Communications Channels

For this Prestashop project, the following communication channels will be used:

- **Written**: Discord channel, project documents stored in gitlab.
- **Verbal**: Discord channel online meetings.

There might be some additions to these, if needed.

## Internal Communications

Internal communications refer to communication within the project group. The goal is to convey project-related information to all members to support collaboration and the formation of group identity. 

- **Daily Scrum**: The project group comes together daily 9 a.m on group discord for daily Scrum meeting. Everyone shares what they've been up to and what will they work on today. Also discuss problems if there are any.

- **Sprint Review**: At the end of sprint at 12:00 (discuss?) to review the Gitlab issue board. What issues have been completed, any leftovers?

- **Documentation**: Project Documentation is is on Gitlab and project progress will be documented through usage of Gitlab's issue board.

- **Mural**: The [mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/demophd0995/m/demophd0995/1748244625911/98f562687b5a69499fff9fc23d2e3896400d6b1b) of this project will contain information about the schedule, epics, roles and stakeholders.

## Communications with Coaches

If problems arise, primary contact should be Okko Tuuri and then Narsu. Both can be reached through Team's Discord channel.
<!--
Good and open communication between the team and the coaches is the key to allow coaches to have clear and complete view of the project, and thereby provide the team with sufficient resources to support the project and its progress. The most important communication channel will be **Zoom**  and **Weekly on Tuesday and Friday** coach meetings with **Rintanmaki Marko**. Assigned project secretary prepares agendas for those meetings and writes notes about them. In addition to the above-mentioned communication channels, the most important channel of communication is **Discord**, other ways are used where possible and necessary. All significant events related to the project will be reported to coaches on at least one of the above mentioned channels.

# Communications with Stakeholder Representatives

Communication with the stakeholder representative takes place primarily via the project's Discord channel and through regular meetings. The responsibility for this communication is shared by the entire team, and all members are expected to participate actively in maintaining contact.

<!--
**Meetings and Emails** play a key role in the communication between the project team and the stakeholder representatives. Regular executive team meetings and their agendas are prepared by the project manager. In addition to the above, the primary communication channel is **Email** and secondary **Contact via Zooms**. For all project documents, assigned project secretary will send copies to the stakeholder representatives by email. **Rintanmaki Marko** is responsible for current affairs on behalf of the stakeholder, and **Project Manager** for project management.
-->
# Communications with External Stakeholders

Although the project currently has no identified external stakeholders, its nature is public and open. The team's website serves as the primary communication channel for any external parties who may express interest in the project. It features regular updates on the project's progress and team activities, as well as contact information for team members, such as links to their LinkedIn profiles. These personal contact links may also serve as a point of initial engagement.

Should any communication with external parties occur, the entire team must be kept informed of such interactions. If external stakeholders do emerge, meetings or reviews can be arranged with them as needed.
<!--
Project team's own judgement is used with communicating with external stakeholders. Some of the external stakeholders have the opportunity to communicate via discord. In addition, external stakeholders are provided information on the project's website.
-->

# Monitoring and Evaluation of Communications
The success of the communications are continuously evaluated during the project. Any inconvenience will be addressed and the communication plan modified if and / or necessary.
