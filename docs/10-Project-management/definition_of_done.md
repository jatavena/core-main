DOD stands for **Definition of Done** in agile development. It is a set of criteria that a team agrees to meet before declaring a product or feature as completed. The purpose of DOD is to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding between the development team and the stakeholders about what constitutes as done. For example, a DOD might include code quality, testing, documentation, and user feedback. You can learn more about DOD from these sources:
