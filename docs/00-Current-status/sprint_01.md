## Reflections on Sprint 01

Sprint 01 was focused on project planning and introduction to technologies and basic of Prestashop. We wrote a lot of documentations such as project plan and requirement specification,
planned features we plan to deliver as part of Prestashop and did a cost estimation based on the work hours and features. Everyone also
got familiarized with setting up virtual machines on CSC servers and setting up Prestashop running on them. We also solidified our communication
protocols that were a bit weak on the sprint00 and feel like there was concrete improvement on that sector.

## Challenges

Not much challeneges on this sprint. There's still some small details we could work on like commenting on tickets on the issue boards so
that we can move tickets to wait for review more efficiently. This seems to be a problem especially on tickets that have the whole team
working on them.

## Potential Solutions

-

## Project Progress

Progress has been alright. Managed to complete majority of tickets by the end of the sprint review.

## What We Learned:

We have studied the technologies and the platforms used. We also improved out communication protocols, so that teamwork should be a bit
more efficient, but that is something that probably needs to worked on throughout the project.

## Ideas and Sensations

## Feedback and Thoughts

## Conclusion

Planning phase is mostly done now and soon we'll be moving to production. There's some difficulties ahead with the shutdown of JAMK
networks for a week and there's also a one week holiday break for everyone. We'll see how things progress from here on out.
