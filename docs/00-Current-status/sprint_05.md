# Sprint 05
Author: Joni Nisula (Team leader)

## Overview
- **Start:** 28.7.2025 
- **End:** 8.8.2025 

## Reflections on Sprint 05

Sprint 05 was the last full-length development sprint before GATE3 demo. Our ops have worked hard on stabilising the system and making sure that the servers stay 
functional. Our testers have created and tested most of the features we have managed to create thus far. Testers have also implemented Robot
Framework to be part of the pipeline. Our developer has tackled some of the bugs that have arisen during testing of the implemented features.

Overall, the project has taken shape are we are in progress of trying to finish as much as we can before the upcoming demo presentation.

## Challenges

We still have slight challenges with communication. Issue board has been hard to read sometimes and keeping track of the progress can be
somewhat difficult.

## Potential Solutions

Project is almost coming to an end, so there's no time and little reward to do any huge improvements to communication strategies. Overall progress
is still fine so I don't think we need new solutions at the moment. 

## Project Progress

Progress has been alright. Some issues have dragged along and were carried over to sprint 06, which is effectively only a week because
GATE3 demo is at the end of the week. Focus is on completing most of the issues in progress. We had some issues planned for sprint06, but due
to time constraints and leftovers from sprint05 they are on a low-priority list.

## What We Learned:

## Ideas and Sensations

## Feedback and Thoughts

## Conclusion
Working towards GATE3 Demo. Finishing as much as possible before it and creating a demonstration of the developed product.

### Reflections on Sprint 00

The sprint was filled with a lot of introductory activities, which helped set the foundation for the course. We did not face significant challenges during this sprint.

At this stage, the overall picture of the course is still a bit unclear, but we understand that it is normal to feel this way when a large amount of information is received all at once. Processing such information takes time, and we are confident that the understanding will become clearer as we progress through the course.

## Challenges

- **Personal Struggles:**
  - Getting used to working on a project

- **Challenges Ahead:**
  - As we continue, We expect to face challenges in managing the workload and time effectively.
  - Understanding complex topics may require more time, and we anticipate that some areas will be difficult to grasp at first.

## Potential Solutions

- **Time Management:**  
  ´We will improve our time management skills to ensure we can complete tasks more efficiently, avoiding delays in the future.


## Project Progress

While the project itself hasn't progressed significantly during Sprint 00, we’ve learned a few important things:

1. **Team Dynamics:**
   - The team’s collaboration started well with the selection of roles and the creation of a team name. This helped us set a clear direction for working together.

2. **Course Materials:**
   - We have become familiar with the course materials, and though We are not yet fully comfortable, we feel confident that we can gradually improve my understanding as we continue working through them.

### What We Learned:

- **Importance of Team Roles:**  
  Understanding and setting clear roles (team leader, administrator) early on made the collaboration smoother. This helped ensure that everyone knew their responsibilities from the start.

- **Course Content:**  
  We learned that it’s important to process course material slowly, especially when a large volume of information is presented at once. Understanding comes with time, and We are learning to take it one step at a time.

### Ideas and Sensations

During this sprint, We had some reflections on the course’s pace and the overall approach:

- The course pace felt manageable but, at times, overwhelming due to the amount of information presented in the first week.
- It was useful to learn that a large portion of learning comes from processing information gradually. We might need to adjust my study habits to accommodate this.

## Feedback and Thoughts

- **Course Pace:**  
  The pace is a bit fast, but it's understandable given the breadth of content. A clearer breakdown of the course material could help students keep up and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
  
- **Future Improvements:**  
  It would be helpful if there were more practical examples to illustrate how the course materials can be applied in real-world scenarios. This could enhance our understanding and application of the topics.

## Conclusion

Sprint 00 was a great start to the course. Although We faced some initial struggles with time management and the pace of the materials, We feel optimistic about the future sprints. The collaboration with my team is off to a good start, and we am looking forward to applying what We’ve learned in upcoming sprints.
