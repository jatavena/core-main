## Reflections on Sprint 02
Sprint 02 was only a week long instead of two, because it had one week summer holiday and also JAMK service maintanance so most of the services used in the project were down.
Sprint 02 was focused on getting project planning done and finalizing getting familiarized to technologies and basics of Prestashop. We also had to get
everything ready to hold a presentation for Gate1 review which was held on Thursday 20th of June.

## Challenges
It was a slight challenge to get everything in order due to time constraints of shortened sprint, but it was ok.

## Potential Solutions

## Project Progress
Planning phase is now largely done, still some documentation that needs to be updated during the project.

## What We Learned:
We learned the basic protocols and progression of a project planning phase.

## Ideas and Sensations

## Feedback and Thoughts

## Conclusion
Moving on to production phase in sprint 03.
