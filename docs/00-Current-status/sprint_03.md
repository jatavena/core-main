# Sprint 03
Author: Joni Nisula (Team leader)

## Overview
- **Start:**  30.6.2025
- **End:** 11.7.2025 

## Reflections on Sprint 03

Sprint 03 was the first sprint in production phase. We had some difficulties setting up the environments, but after that we proceeded into selecting features
to develop and deliver. We set out on delivering number of different features and managed to deliver some of them on schedule. We found production phase to be
somewhat taxing as we feel some of the user stories are not that well defined as to when you can say they are fully completed. Also the need for
more communication and ensuring the communication is clear and understood on equal level.

## Challenges

I guess the communication is always a challenge and to be improved upon. Also moving on to production causes some challenges to get used to.

## Potential Solutions

Being more active and also improving the protocols on how we work in production phase is something we need to find ways to improve upon.

## Project Progress

So far the progress has been alright. Slightly behind the set schedule, but it was set in a way that the wroklaod was heavier in the beginning, so that it's
not the end of the world when delivery of the features gets delayed.

## What We Learned:

Working in production phase is something we learn every day and improving our work habits.

## Ideas and Sensations

## Feedback and Thoughts

## Conclusion
Development is off to a decent start, but it's a lot of work and we need to learn how to streamline processes and protocols and make teamwork
more efficient.

### Reflections on Sprint 00

The sprint was filled with a lot of introductory activities, which helped set the foundation for the course. We did not face significant challenges during this sprint.

At this stage, the overall picture of the course is still a bit unclear, but we understand that it is normal to feel this way when a large amount of information is received all at once. Processing such information takes time, and we are confident that the understanding will become clearer as we progress through the course.

## Challenges

- **Personal Struggles:**
  - Getting used to working on a project

- **Challenges Ahead:**
  - As we continue, We expect to face challenges in managing the workload and time effectively.
  - Understanding complex topics may require more time, and we anticipate that some areas will be difficult to grasp at first.

## Potential Solutions

- **Time Management:**  
  ´We will improve our time management skills to ensure we can complete tasks more efficiently, avoiding delays in the future.


## Project Progress

While the project itself hasn't progressed significantly during Sprint 00, we’ve learned a few important things:

1. **Team Dynamics:**
   - The team’s collaboration started well with the selection of roles and the creation of a team name. This helped us set a clear direction for working together.

2. **Course Materials:**
   - We have become familiar with the course materials, and though We are not yet fully comfortable, we feel confident that we can gradually improve my understanding as we continue working through them.

### What We Learned:

- **Importance of Team Roles:**  
  Understanding and setting clear roles (team leader, administrator) early on made the collaboration smoother. This helped ensure that everyone knew their responsibilities from the start.

- **Course Content:**  
  We learned that it’s important to process course material slowly, especially when a large volume of information is presented at once. Understanding comes with time, and We are learning to take it one step at a time.

### Ideas and Sensations

During this sprint, We had some reflections on the course’s pace and the overall approach:

- The course pace felt manageable but, at times, overwhelming due to the amount of information presented in the first week.
- It was useful to learn that a large portion of learning comes from processing information gradually. We might need to adjust my study habits to accommodate this.

## Feedback and Thoughts

- **Course Pace:**  
  The pace is a bit fast, but it's understandable given the breadth of content. A clearer breakdown of the course material could help students keep up and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
  
- **Future Improvements:**  
  It would be helpful if there were more practical examples to illustrate how the course materials can be applied in real-world scenarios. This could enhance our understanding and application of the topics.

## Conclusion

Sprint 00 was a great start to the course. Although We faced some initial struggles with time management and the pace of the materials, We feel optimistic about the future sprints. The collaboration with my team is off to a good start, and we am looking forward to applying what We’ve learned in upcoming sprints.
