# Sprint 04
Author: Joni Nisula (Team leader)

## Overview
- **Start:**  14.7.2025
- **End:** 25.7.2025 

## Reflections on Sprint 04

Sprint 04 was the second sprint in production phase. Overall we have made decent progress. We have had some problems in making the server-side
stable and not break down constantly. Our OPS has done a lot of work to make servers stay up and stable. Then we had some difficulties
impelemention a solution to prestashop and email and tried different providers and there seemed to always be some difficulties and problems
in some aspects of it. In the end we decided to set up gmail and it has worked so far without issues.

There has also been great progress in testing and security sector. Our testers have created a myriad of different tests for our impelemented and
soon to be implemeneted features. Security has studied and gathered information about security threats and solutions, like different scanning and 
security programs for those threats that are a danger to our Prestashop platform.

## Challenges

As I already mentioned in the previous segment, we had some problems with server-side stability, but those were mostly resolved and our
project seems to be stabile at the moment. We recognized some lack of communication and decided to increase meeting by adding one extra meeting to the end of the
week to discuss status of the project.

## Potential Solutions

Currently we don't have any serious problems that need solving.

## Project Progress

Progress has been decent. Slightly behind the set schedule, but a many planned of the features are mostly implemented, just lacking in some departments and thus
not completed. We need to work a little on these get them through the finish line.

## What We Learned:

Not everything goes to plan and you have to adapt to the difficulties and problems which arise during the production. For example if servers are down
and under fixing you need to find ways to work towards the goals of the project.

## Ideas and Sensations

## Feedback and Thoughts

## Conclusion
Development is going okay. Moving towards the goal steadily. Some aspects can be still improved.

### Reflections on Sprint 00

The sprint was filled with a lot of introductory activities, which helped set the foundation for the course. We did not face significant challenges during this sprint.

At this stage, the overall picture of the course is still a bit unclear, but we understand that it is normal to feel this way when a large amount of information is received all at once. Processing such information takes time, and we are confident that the understanding will become clearer as we progress through the course.

## Challenges

- **Personal Struggles:**
  - Getting used to working on a project

- **Challenges Ahead:**
  - As we continue, We expect to face challenges in managing the workload and time effectively.
  - Understanding complex topics may require more time, and we anticipate that some areas will be difficult to grasp at first.

## Potential Solutions

- **Time Management:**  
  ´We will improve our time management skills to ensure we can complete tasks more efficiently, avoiding delays in the future.


## Project Progress

While the project itself hasn't progressed significantly during Sprint 00, we’ve learned a few important things:

1. **Team Dynamics:**
   - The team’s collaboration started well with the selection of roles and the creation of a team name. This helped us set a clear direction for working together.

2. **Course Materials:**
   - We have become familiar with the course materials, and though We are not yet fully comfortable, we feel confident that we can gradually improve my understanding as we continue working through them.

### What We Learned:

- **Importance of Team Roles:**  
  Understanding and setting clear roles (team leader, administrator) early on made the collaboration smoother. This helped ensure that everyone knew their responsibilities from the start.

- **Course Content:**  
  We learned that it’s important to process course material slowly, especially when a large volume of information is presented at once. Understanding comes with time, and We are learning to take it one step at a time.

### Ideas and Sensations

During this sprint, We had some reflections on the course’s pace and the overall approach:

- The course pace felt manageable but, at times, overwhelming due to the amount of information presented in the first week.
- It was useful to learn that a large portion of learning comes from processing information gradually. We might need to adjust my study habits to accommodate this.

## Feedback and Thoughts

- **Course Pace:**  
  The pace is a bit fast, but it's understandable given the breadth of content. A clearer breakdown of the course material could help students keep up and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
  
- **Future Improvements:**  
  It would be helpful if there were more practical examples to illustrate how the course materials can be applied in real-world scenarios. This could enhance our understanding and application of the topics.

## Conclusion

Sprint 00 was a great start to the course. Although We faced some initial struggles with time management and the pace of the materials, We feel optimistic about the future sprints. The collaboration with my team is off to a good start, and we am looking forward to applying what We’ve learned in upcoming sprints.
