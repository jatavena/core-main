# Sprint 00 - Course Begins

## Overview
- **Start:** 26.05.2025
- **End:** 30.05.2025

## Reflections on Sprint 00

Sprint 00 was introductory and we went through the basic materials and got familiar with
the platforms used during this project. We decided a team name, logo, created a basic frame for our website and edited
few project planning documents.

## Challenges

We didn't encounter any major challenges yet, but something to keep eye on is
the flow of communication inside the team. We need to get communication protocols in order so
that it doesn't become a problem when we get into production.

## Potential Solutions

We need to be more active on reporting what we are working on and how
things are proceeding.

## Project Progress

So far the progress has been alright, but the sprint has been introductory part of the project
and progress is harder to gauge at the moment. 

## What We Learned:

Importance of good communication inside the team.

## Ideas and Sensations

## Feedback and Thoughts

## Conclusion
We are off to a decent start, but there are some project management stuff we need to work on.
We have studied the materials needed for the project, named the team and created a logo, made a website and started working on project planning documentation.

### Reflections on Sprint 00

The sprint was filled with a lot of introductory activities, which helped set the foundation for the course. We did not face significant challenges during this sprint.

At this stage, the overall picture of the course is still a bit unclear, but we understand that it is normal to feel this way when a large amount of information is received all at once. Processing such information takes time, and we are confident that the understanding will become clearer as we progress through the course.

## Challenges

- **Personal Struggles:**
  - Getting used to working on a project

- **Challenges Ahead:**
  - As we continue, We expect to face challenges in managing the workload and time effectively.
  - Understanding complex topics may require more time, and we anticipate that some areas will be difficult to grasp at first.

## Potential Solutions

- **Time Management:**  
  ´We will improve our time management skills to ensure we can complete tasks more efficiently, avoiding delays in the future.


## Project Progress

While the project itself hasn't progressed significantly during Sprint 00, we’ve learned a few important things:

1. **Team Dynamics:**
   - The team’s collaboration started well with the selection of roles and the creation of a team name. This helped us set a clear direction for working together.

2. **Course Materials:**
   - We have become familiar with the course materials, and though We are not yet fully comfortable, we feel confident that we can gradually improve my understanding as we continue working through them.

### What We Learned:

- **Importance of Team Roles:**  
  Understanding and setting clear roles (team leader, administrator) early on made the collaboration smoother. This helped ensure that everyone knew their responsibilities from the start.

- **Course Content:**  
  We learned that it’s important to process course material slowly, especially when a large volume of information is presented at once. Understanding comes with time, and We are learning to take it one step at a time.

### Ideas and Sensations

During this sprint, We had some reflections on the course’s pace and the overall approach:

- The course pace felt manageable but, at times, overwhelming due to the amount of information presented in the first week.
- It was useful to learn that a large portion of learning comes from processing information gradually. We might need to adjust my study habits to accommodate this.

## Feedback and Thoughts

- **Course Pace:**  
  The pace is a bit fast, but it's understandable given the breadth of content. A clearer breakdown of the course material could help students keep up and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
  
- **Future Improvements:**  
  It would be helpful if there were more practical examples to illustrate how the course materials can be applied in real-world scenarios. This could enhance our understanding and application of the topics.

## Conclusion

Sprint 00 was a great start to the course. Although We faced some initial struggles with time management and the pace of the materials, We feel optimistic about the future sprints. The collaboration with my team is off to a good start, and we am looking forward to applying what We’ve learned in upcoming sprints.
