| [User Story 013](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/177)     | As a system administrator, I want to be able to quickly and easily roll back a deployment in case of issues, so that service availability is minimally impacted.    |
| [User Story 014](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/178)     | As a test engineer, I want to trigger specific automated tests once the build process is successful, so I can validate the latest changes without manual coordination or execution. |
| [User Story 015](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/179)     | As team leader, I would like to be notified when builds fail or when tests fail on the main branch, allowing me to monitor the health of the development process. |
