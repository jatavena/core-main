| [User Story 010](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/174)    | As a developer, I want to be able to deploy my code changes to production with a single click, so that I can quickly and easily release new features |
| [User Story 011](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/175)     |As a test engineer, I need the pipeline to automatically execute regression test for selected features, and other tests so that I can be sure that the system is working well |
| [User Story 012](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/176)     | As an operations engineer, I need the pipeline to deploy the software to different environments (e.g., staging, production) so that updated versions are delivered rapidly and reliably |

### User interface mock-up

No changes to user interface

### Testing / possible acceptance criteria

- Developer can deploy code changes to production with a single click, ensuring fast and easy feature releases. (Test Case)

- Regression and other automated tests are triggered automatically after a successful build to validate system functionality. (Test Case)

- Software is deployed to multiple environments (e.g., staging, production) in a reliable and traceable manner. (Test Case)

- Team leader receives notifications on build or test failures on the main branch to monitor pipeline health. (Test Case)
