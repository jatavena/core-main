| [User Story 046](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/203) | As a security engineer, I want our system to be integrated with a vulnerability scanning tool,So that I can continuously ensure our system's security and identify any potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited |
| [User Story 047](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/204) | As a system administrator, I want the vulnerability scanning tool to send alerts directly to my dashboard,So that I can react promptly to any threats and mitigate any potential damage
| [User Story 048](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/205) | As a DevOps engineer, I want the scanning tool to be integrated into our CI/CD pipeline,So that I can catch potential vulnerabilities early in the development process before they get deployed to production |
| [User Story 049](https://gitlab.labranet.jamk.fi/ohtu-project/core/-/issues/206) | As a team leader, I want the vulnerability scanning tool to be integrated in our workflow,So that I can assure our clients that our product is developed and maintained with best security practices in mind, and thus, improve customer trust and satisfaction |

### User interface mock-up

No changes to user interface

### Testing / possible acceptance criteria

- All containers run with a non-root user by default, and security contexts are defined in deployment configurations (e.g., Kubernetes YAML or Docker Compose).

- A vulnerability scanning tool is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and automatically scans container images during build and deployment stages.

- The scanning tool sends real-time alerts to the system administrator’s dashboard when vulnerabilities are detected, and logs are accessible for auditing.
