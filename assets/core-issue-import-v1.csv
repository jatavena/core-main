BUG2000 - No confirmation email is received in the registered email inbox. The user remains unverified. - EXAMPLE,"## Summary

During the testing of the user registration process, I encountered an issue where new users are unable to receive a confirmation email after registering. This prevents them from completing the registration process and logging into the system.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Go to the registration page.
1. Fill out the registration form with valid information.
1. Click the ""Register"" button.

**What is the current bug behavior?**


1. No confirmation email is received in the registered email inbox. The user remains unverified.

**What is the expected correct behavior?**

1. After successful registration, a confirmation email should be sent to the user's registered email address.

**Relevant logs and/or screenshots**

1. This issue was replicated on both the development and staging environments.
I have verified that the email address provided during registration is correct.
Other email notifications from the system (e.g., password reset emails) appear to be working as expected.

Example of Enhancement Request-  User Activity Tracking,"#  Enhancement/ Feature proposal (template)

The customer works in the field of human resource management and regularly uses our software product for personnel management. The customer's organization has identified a need for more precise tracking of employees' activity and productivity.


## What is the current need for feature/enhancement?

The customer proposes a new feature that would enable tracking of user activity within the software. This could include the following components:

1. Activity Measurement: The software could collect data on how long each employee is logged into the system daily, how many tasks they complete, and how much time they spend on different functions within the software.

1. Reporting and Visualization: The software would provide reporting tools allowing the organization to review user activity data. This could include daily, weekly, and monthly reports, as well as graphical visualizations.

1. Alerts: Users could set alerts that trigger if, for instance, specific activity targets are not met. Such alerts could help the organization respond promptly to any deviations.


The customer's proposed development idea could bring significant added value to our software product and its users, helping the organization improve its performance and resource management. The development team should now assess the technical feasibility of the proposal and prioritize it as needed within the product development roadmap.

## Who are stakeholders

1. The customer has expressed a need to closely monitor employee activity in their work. This could provide added value to the organization, allowing it to ensure resources are utilized efficiently and that specific functions are neither underutilized nor overutilized.

Example of Risk Issue,"# Risk Example: Unrealistic Project Deadlines

## Description
The project timeline may be too aggressive, leading to rushed development and potential quality issues.
This risk is common in software development projects, especially when the scope of the project is not well defined or understood. It's important to manage this risk effectively to ensure the successful delivery of the project.


## Category
Project Management

## Probability
High

## Impact
If the project is rushed to meet unrealistic deadlines, it could lead to bugs in the software, poor user experience, and ultimately, damage to the company's reputation.

## Mitigation Strategy
- Regularly review and update the project schedule.
- Ensure that project timelines are realistic and take into account potential delays.
- Implement agile methodologies to allow for flexibility in development.
